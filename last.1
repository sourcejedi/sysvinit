.\"{{{  Description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Last
searches back through the file \fB/etc/wtmp\fP to show a list of all
users logged in (and out) since that file was created.  Names of users
and tty's can be given, and then \fBlast\fP will show only those entries
matching the arguments.  Names of ttys can be abbreviated, thus \fBlast
0\fP is the same as \fBlast tty0\fP.  When \fBlast\fP catches a
\s-2SIGINT\s0 (generated by the interrupt key, usually control-C) or a
\s-2SIGQUIT\s0 (generated by the quit keys, sually control-\e)
\fBlast\fP will show how far it was searching through the file and in
the case of \s-2SIGINT\s0 last\fP will terminate.
.PP
The pseudo user \fBreboot\fP logs in each time the system is rebooted.
Thus \fBlast reboot\fP will show a log of all reboots since the log file
was created.
.PP
\fBLastb\fP is the same as \fBlast\fP, except that it shows a log of the
file \fB/etc/btmp\fP which contains all the bad login attempts.
