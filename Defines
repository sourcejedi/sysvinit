This file describes the defines you can toggle at the top of init.c.

SYSLOG	- Use syslog for logging instead of directly writing to the
	  console. I added this because Peter Macdonald asked it
	  for his SLS release. It defaults to on, but for Linuxes
	  < 0.99 you should turn it off.

SHELL	- This is the shell that's used for executing the commands
	  from inittab.

SOME_USER The numeric id of the user to setuid() to before running
	  the SU command.

SU	- The command that is being run in single user mode. It might
	  just as well be /bin/sh, but if you define SOME_USER to
	  something else as 0, su will ask for a password before
	  allowing you to go into single user mode. This is if you
	  are paranoid - people could boot your machine when it's
	  unattended into single user mode (with lilo, for example:
	  Boot: linux single )

The other defines describe themselves, I won't explain them because
I doubt anyone would ever want to change them.
